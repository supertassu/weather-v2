# Tassu's Boilerplate

A boilerplate for Koa and React, utilizing AVA and XO for testing and code style.
This is a grab-and-go style starter kit for any web development project for me.

## Setup & usage

```bash
# setup
git clone https://github.com/supertassu/broilerplate project-name
cd project-name
npm install

# usage
npm run dev # starts webpack in watch mode, starts web server and starts xo and ava in watch mode
npm run build && npm test && npm start # builds files, runs tests and starts web server
```

## TODO

- [ ] Support HTTPS
- [ ] Make it ready to deploy to Heroku
- [ ] Make it ready to deploy to Now
